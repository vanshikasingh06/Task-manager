In today's fast-paced world, staying organized and managing our daily tasks efficiently has become more crucial than ever. With numerous responsibilities demanding our attention, a well-structured to-do list has emerged as an indispensable tool for keeping track of our activities, boosting productivity and maintaining a sense of accomplishment. However, in a digital landscape that extends across various devices and screen sizes, our to-do list mustn't be confined to a single platform. This is where the concept of a responsive to-do list comes into play.
A responsive to-do list ensures that your task management companion is as adaptable as you are.
This project is on frontend web development which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a simple  and interactive  to-do list   website that can be used for productivity and help you to manage your tasks efficiently.
